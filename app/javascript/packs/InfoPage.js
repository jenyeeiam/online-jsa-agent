      <h3>Who are we?</h3>
      <p className="info">Nippon Softball was created as a method of communication between foreign players and Japanese coaches. The Japanese Professional League consists of 12 teams where some choose to have up to 2 foreign players. Traditionally, teams choose to hire an agent in order to recruit players, but we are trying to speed up that process by providing a direct form of communication.</p>
      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p className="info">Any player that is interested in playing in Japan is encouraged to sign up and create a profile. Coaches who are members of Nippon Softball are able to see the profiles of all the players. If he or she is interested in a particular player, they will contact her by sending a message. Japanese teams are always looking for new players because foreign players generally only stay for 1-2 seasons. It is a big commitment on behalf of the player where the season runs from February to November, so often it is difficult for teams to find players who are interested and available to play.</p>
      <h3>How are the translations created?</h3>
      <p className="info">All translations are provided by Bing Translate. Yes, we realize they are not perfect, but the messages are intended as a first introduction between parties. If the team and player are mutually interested, we will provide an interpreter to conduct more intensive communication.</p>
      <h3>{"Why aren't coaches' names and teams listed?"}</h3>
      <p className="info">Names and teams are not included to provide objectivity between players and coaches. Also, coaches in the Japanese league rarely wish to share which players they are recruiting.</p>
      <h3>I provided all my stats, videos and accolades, but no one has contacted me!</h3>
      <p className="info">Unfortunately there are not many available positions for foreign players in Japan. The highest demand is for pitchers and catchers but occasionally teams will recruit a positional player and good hitter. Nippon Softball was created to speed up the recruiting process for Japanese professional teams and the unfortunate reality is that not every player who would like to play in Japan will be able to.</p>
